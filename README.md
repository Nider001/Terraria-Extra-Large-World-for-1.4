# Terraria-Extra-Large-World-for-1.4
This is my version of Extra Large World mod for the latest TModLoader 1.4 beta. It forces every world you create to have a fixed size of 16800x2400 tiles. When you generate the world just use the large world option and whatever other options you want.

To use the mod itself just drop the '.tmod' file inside your 'Documents\my games\Terraria\ModLoader\Beta\Mods' folder. The current version is quite unstable, so be prepared for a few 'IndexOutOfRange' exceptions before the world successfully generates.

In case you want to save some time you can use the following seed which worked for me: 1988617039
If you just want the world, you can extract it from the archive (I created that backup right after the world generation).

If you are interested in fixed abovementioned exception, I also included the source files of my mod. Feel free to tweak them as you wish.
